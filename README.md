# Shell scripts library
Shlib is a library to easily manage own shell scripts from terminal in Linux. Imported scripts can be immediately used as traditional commands.

## Example
This is an example of shell script called `helloworld` stored in `~/`
```Shell
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello world!"
```
Adding this script to the library, it is used as a command
```ShellSession
[guest@github ~]$ shlib -a helloworld
[guest@github ~]$ helloworld
Hello World!
```
Print all scripts in the library
```ShellSession
[guest@github ~]$ shlib -l
anonimize	createtxt	helloworld	tarandrm
```

To install shlib, navigate with `cd` command into downloaded repo folder and run installation script with `sudo ./initshlib`.
